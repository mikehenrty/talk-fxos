## A Brief History
 * What (Firefox OS)
 * Who (Andreas Gal, Chris Jones, Mozilla)
 * When (Summer, 2011)
 * How (Magic)
 * ... but WHY???

## In the beginning (the who and the when)
 * Just released Firefox 4 \o/
 * Chris Jones and Andreas Gal were in Taiwan celebrating
 * Working on PDF.js, wondering what else they can do with javascript
 * I think we can build an entire phone on it.
 * ok, lets do it until we cant

## Can we build it? (the how)
 * July 25, 2011, Andreas announcement on the mailing list
 * Sept 17, 2011, first commit https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commit/f46aa5aba29008ce8733c92bfd1ddda210fc7c43
 * July 1, 2013, First FxOS device released by Telephonica in Spain
 * Today it is in 30 countries, http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/where-is-firefox-os/
 * 17 commercial phones, 13 non-commercial phones, 2 tablets, 1 TV, 4 IoT boards, at least one drone
 * https://firefoxosdevices.org

## Architecture (the how)
 * 3 layers, linux kernel (gonk), firefox (gecko), html5 (gaia)
 * Gonk, similar to AOSP kernel, includes some proprietary drivers (RIL)
 * Gecko, same rendering/layout engine used by desktop browser
 * Gaia, all the UI for the phone including window management and homescreen
   * System app maintains iframes for each running app

## Mozilla Mission (the why)
Our mission is to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web. [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/)

# FxOS Mission: Unleash the power of mobile on the web
 * "When native has something the web doesnâ€™t, we should consider it a bug." -Jake Archibald
 * Hardware APIs
 * Offline Support
 * Notifications
 * Homescreen Icons

# FxOS Mission: Bring the power of the wed to mobile
 * Devloper workflow
 * Cross-platform for free
 * Deep linking
 * Search bar (history, frecency, bookmarks, search suggestions)
 * User workflow, tab management

# FxOS Mission: Privacy and Openness first
 * Story Time: Global Search for contacts
 * we cant do search suggestions, send contacts to google
 * updates, how do we distribute builds?

## But who is it for?
 * ...the next billion, emerging markets
 * ultra low end, $25
 * tech unsavvy
 * privacy concious

## Some tough lessons
 * People dont buy technology (java vs swift vs js)
 * People dont care about Web vs. Native
 * Some people dont know the differince between FB and internet
 * People dont need "the internet"
 * People NEED communication services, FB, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, Skype
 * We cant provide, not because its impossible, because its out of our hands

## More tough lessons
 * We are not apple
 * We are a software company learning about hardware
 * Hardware is complex
   * Expensive
   * Cannot be open source, cannot provide updates
   * Test devices different than market devices
   * Much more is out of our hands
 * We never wanted to use it ourselves.

## Ignite
 * Firefox 1.0 succeeded by being something we wanted to use
 * How can we make Firefox OS something we (Mozilla) wants?
   * Nice hardware, leverage existing devices (not build or own)
   * Customizable (Add-ons, themes, hacker apps)
   * Instead of spending money on Marketing...
   * Spend money on people who want to see product grow
   * Foxfooding

## Community
 * Participation Hub
 * Porting (new phones, but also IoT devices)
 * Foxfooding
 * hacking

## More Devices
 * TV, already successful
 * Rasberri Pi
 * Wearables??
 * Drones??

## David vs. Goliath, again
 * We will never beat Google or Apple at their own game
 * But we can build something important
   * Privacy centric alternative
     * data is your own, privacy is exposed not hidden
   * The mobile web on any device, true cross platform
   * Customizable by hackers, tinkerers, students, teachers
   * Now and forever open source

## We need your help!
